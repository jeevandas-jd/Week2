A vector database is a system designed to store and manage vectors—fixed-length numerical representations of data—along with other associated information. These databases are optimized for searching and retrieving data using vector similarity, often through Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms. When a query is made, the system finds vectors in the database that are most similar to the query vector.

Vectors are mathematical representations of data in high-dimensional spaces, where each dimension corresponds to a specific feature. The number of dimensions can vary from hundreds to tens of thousands, depending on the complexity of the data. The position of a vector in this space reflects the characteristics of the data it represents. This allows similar data to be located near each other in the space.

Different types of data—including text (like words and documents), images, audio, and more—can be transformed into vectors. This transformation is done using machine learning techniques such as feature extraction, word embeddings, or deep learning models. The goal is to create vector representations where semantically similar items are placed closer together.

Vector databases are widely used in tasks like similarity search, semantic search, multi-modal search, recommendation systems, and object detection. They are also useful in working with large language models (LLMs), especially for enhancing their responses through external information.

One common use case is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this method, documents from a particular domain are first broken down and converted into embeddings (feature vectors). These vectors are stored in the vector database. When a user submits a query, the system converts it into a vector and retrieves the most relevant stored vectors (documents). These documents are then passed into the context of a large language model to help generate a more informed and accurate response.

This process allows the language model to provide domain-specific answers without needing to be retrained. It combines the power of search with natural language generation, improving accuracy and relevance. As a result, vector databases play a key role in many modern AI applications.
