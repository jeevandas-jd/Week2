11.1  INTRODUCTION
The Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on
the generation and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1887 strongly
established the wave nature of light. Towards the same period at the end
of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity
(electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led
to many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895,
and of electron by J.J.Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in
the understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently
low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took
place between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas
in the discharge tube.A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite
to cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass,
it  being  yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence
was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the
cathode. These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William
Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams
of fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist
J.J. Thomson (1856-1940) confirmed this hypothesis. By applying
mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge
tube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speed

and the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (e/m)] of the cathode ray
particles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1
to 0.2 times the speed of light (3 ×108 m/s).The presently accepted value
of e/m is 1.76 × 1011 C/kg. Further, the value of e/m was found to be
independent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode
(emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation
suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles. Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when
irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having
small speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were
found to emit negatively charged particles. The value of e/m of these particles
was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These
observations thus established that all these particles, although produced
under different conditions, were identical in nature. J.J. Thomson, in 1897,
named these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were
fundamental, universal  constituents of matter. For his epoch-making
discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental
investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R.A. Millikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for
the precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that  the
charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary
charge, 1.602 × 10–19 C. Millikan’s experiment established that electric
charge is quantised. From the values of charge (e) and specific charge
(e/m), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined. 11.2  ELECTRON EMISSION
We know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that
are responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot
normally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come
out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge  and pulls the
electron back to  the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal
surface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can
come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome
the attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be
given  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This
minimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface
is called the work function of the metal. It is generally denoted by f0 and
measured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an
electron when it has been accelerated by  a  potential difference  of 1 volt, so
that  1 eV = 1.602 ×10–19 J. This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics. The work function (f0)  depends on the properties of the metal and the
nature of its surface. The minimum energy required for the electron emission from the metal
surface can be supplied to the free electrons by any one of the following
physical processes:
(i)
Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy
can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the
metal. Reprint 2025-26

276
(ii) Field emission: By applying a very strong electric field (of the order of
108 V m–1) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a
spark plug. (iii) Photoelectric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates
a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These
photo(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons. 11.3  PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
11.3.1  Hertz’s observations
The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by
Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments. In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic
waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage
sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate
was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp. Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of
free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls
on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy
from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions
in the material of the surface.After gaining sufficient energy from the
incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the
surrounding space. 11.3.2  Hallwachs’ and Lenard’s observations
Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of
photoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902. Lenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were
allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing
two electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig. 11.1). As
soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also
stopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall
on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted
towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons
flow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus,
light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external
circuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with
collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light. Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a
negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the
zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was
irradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a  positively charged
zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by
ultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively
charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of
ultraviolet light. After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the
incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Due

and Matter
to negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector
plate by the electric field. Hallwachs and  Lenard also observed that when
ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all
when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain
minimum value, called the threshold frequency. This minimum frequency
depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate. It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc.,
responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause
electron emission from the surface. However, some alkali metals such as
lithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive
even to visible light. All these photosensitive substances emit electrons
when they are illuminated by light. After the discovery of electrons, these
electrons were termed as photoelectrons. The phenomenon is called
photoelectric effect. 11.4 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC
EFFECT
Figure 11.1 depicts a  schematic view of the arrangement used for the
experimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated
glass/quartz tube having a thin photosensitive plate C and another metal
plate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short
wavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive
plate C  (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass
tube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate
the photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and
are collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the
battery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates
C and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be
reversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired
positive or negative potential with respect to emitter C. When the collector plate A is positive with respect to the
emitter plate C, the electrons are attracted to it. The
emission of electrons causes flow of electric current in
the circuit. The potential difference between the emitter
and collector plates is measured by a voltmeter (V)
whereas the resulting photo current flowing in the circuit
is measured by a microammeter (mA). The photoelectric
current can be increased or decreased by varying the
potential of collector plate A with respect to the emitter
plate C. The intensity and frequency of the incident light
can be varied, as can the potential difference V between
the emitter C and the collector A. We can use the experimental arrangement of Fig. 11.1 to study the variation of photocurrent with (a)
intensity of radiation, (b) frequency of incident radiation,
(c) the potential difference between the plates A and C,
and (d) the nature of the material of plate C. Light of
different frequencies can be used by putting appropriate
coloured filter or coloured glass in the path of light falling

on the emitter C. The intensity of light is varied by changing
the distance of the light source from the emitter. 11.4.1  Effect of intensity of light on photocurrent
The collector A is maintained at a positive potential with
respect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are
attracted towards collector A. Keeping the frequency of the
incident radiation and the potential fixed, the intensity of
light is varied and the resulting photoelectric current is
measured each time. It is found that the photocurrent
increases linearly with intensity of incident light as shown
graphically in Fig. 11.2. The photocurrent is directly
proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per
second. This implies that the number of photoelectrons
emitted per second is directly proportional to the intensity
of incident radiation. 11.4.2  Effect of potential on photoelectric current
We first keep the plate A at some positive potential with respect to the
plate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency n  and fixed
intensity I1. We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and
measure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the
photoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating)
potential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the
emitted electrons are  collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current
becomes maximum or  saturates. If we increase the accelerating potential
of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum
value of the photoelectric current is called  saturation current. Saturation
current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by
the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A. We now apply a negative (retarding)
potential to the plate A with respect to the
plate C and make it increasingly negative
gradually. When the polarity is reversed,
the electrons are repelled and only the
sufficiently energetic electrons are able to
reach the collector A. The photocurrent
is found to decrease rapidly until it drops
to zero at a certain sharply defined,
critical value of the negative potential V0
on the plate A. For a particular frequency
of incident radiation, the minimum
negative (retarding) potential V0 given to
the plate A for which the photocurrent
stops or becomes zero is called the cut-
off or stopping potential. The interpretation of the observation
in 
terms 
of 
photoelectrons 
is
straightforward. All the photoelectrons
emitted from the metal do not have the

same energy. Photoelectric current is zero when the stopping potential is
sufficient to repel even the most energetic photoelectrons, with the
maximum kinetic energy (Kmax), so that
Kmax = e V0
(11.1)
We can now repeat this experiment with incident radiation of the same
frequency but of higher intensity I2 and I3 (I3 > I2 > I1). We note that the
saturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows
that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the
intensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the
same as that for the incident radiation of intensity I1, as shown graphically
in Fig. 11.3. Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the
stopping potential is independent of its intensity. In other words, the
maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source
and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident
radiation. 11.4.3 Effect of frequency of incident radiation on
stopping potential
FIGURE 11.4 Variation of photoelectric current
with collector plate potential for different
frequencies of incident radiation. FIGURE 11.5 Variation of stopping potential V0
with frequency n of incident radiation for a
given photosensitive material. We now study the relation between the frequency
n of the incident radiation and the stopping
potential V0. We suitably adjust the same
intensity of light radiation at various frequencies
and study the variation of photocurrent with
collector plate potential. The resulting variation
is shown in Fig. 11.4. We obtain different values
of stopping potential but the same value of the
saturation current for incident radiation of
different frequencies. The energy of the emitted
electrons depends on the frequency of the
incident radiations. The stopping potential is
more negative for higher frequencies of incident
radiation. Note from Fig. 11.4  that the stopping
potentials are in the order V03 > V02 > V01 if the
frequencies are in the order n3 > n2 > n1 . This
implies that greater the frequency of incident
light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of
the photoelectrons. Consequently, we need
greater retarding potential to stop them
completely. If we plot a graph between the
frequency of incident radiation and the
corresponding stopping potential for different
metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig. 11.5. The graph shows that
(i)
the stopping potential V0 varies linearly with
the frequency of incident radiation for a given
photosensitive material. (ii) there exists a certain minimum cut-off
frequency n0 for which the stopping potential
is zero. Reprint 2025-26

280
These observations have two implications:
(i)
The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly
with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its
intensity. (ii) For a frequency n of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off
frequency n0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the
intensity is large. This minimum, cut-off frequency n0, is called the threshold frequency. It is different for different metals.Different photosensitive materials respond differently to light. Selenium
is more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance
gives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example,
ultraviolet light gives rise to  photoelectric effect in copper  while green or
red light does not. Note that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of
the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric
emission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if
the incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in
a time of the order of 10– 9 s or less. We now summarise the experimental features and observations
described in this section. (i)
For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation
(above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly
proportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 11.2). (ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation,
saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of
incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of
its intensity (Fig. 11.3). (iii) For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum
cut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold
frequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place,
no matter how intense the incident light is. Above the threshold
frequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic
energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the
frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity
(Fig. 11.5). (iv) The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any
apparent time lag (~10– 9s or less), even when the incident radiation is
made exceedingly dim. 11.5 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY
OF LIGHT
The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth
century. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were
explained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light. According to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting  of
electric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over
the region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this
Reprint 2025-26
281

and Matter
wave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric
emission given in the previous section. According to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface
of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant
energy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are
the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater
the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron. In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the
surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no
matter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of
radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to
the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape
from the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist. These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i),
(ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3. Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of
energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire
wavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy,
the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small. Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single
electron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and
come out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to
observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous.In short,
the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of
photoelectric  emission. 11.6 EINSTEIN’S PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION: ENERGY
QUANTUM OF RADIATION
In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed a radically new picture
of electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect. In this picture,
photoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of
energy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units – the
so called quanta of energy of radiation. Each quantum of radiant energy
has energy hn, where h is Planck’s constant and n the frequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (hn ) of
radiation. If this quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum
energy needed for the electron to escape from the metal surface (work
function f0), the electron is emitted with maximum kinetic energy
Kmax = hn – f0
(11.2)
More tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less
than the maximum value. Note that the intensity of light of a given
frequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second. Increasing the intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons per
second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted
photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon. Equation (11.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation. We
now see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all
the observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of  sub-section
11.4.3. Reprint 2025-26
Physics
282
·
According to Eq. (11.2), Kmax depends linearly on n,
and is independent of intensity of radiation, in
agreement with observation. This has happened
because in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises
from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation
by a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is
proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit
area per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process. ·
Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (11.2 ) implies
that photoelectric emission is possible only if
h n > f0
or n > n0 , where
n0 = 
0
h
φ
(11.3)
Equation (11.3) shows that the greater the work
function f0, the higher the minimum or threshold
frequency n0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus,
there exists a threshold frequency n0 (= f0/h) for the
metal surface, below which no photoelectric  emission
is possible, no matter how intense the incident
radiation may be or how long it falls on the surface. ·
In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above,
is proportional to the number of energy quanta per
unit area per unit time. The greater the number of
energy quanta available, the greater is the number of
electrons absorbing the energy quanta  and greater,
therefore, is the number of electrons coming out of
the metal (for n > n0). This explains why, for n > n0,
photoelectric current is proportional to intensity. ·
In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process
involved in photoelectric effect is the absorption of a
light quantum by an electron. This process is
instantaneous. Thus, whatever may be the intensity
i.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area
per unit time, photoelectric emission is instantaneous. Low intensity does not mean delay in emission, since
the basic elementary process is the same. Intensity
only determines how many electrons are able to
participate in the elementary process (absorption of a
light quantum by a single electron) and, therefore, the
photoelectric current. Using Eq.(11.1), the photoelectric equation, Eq. (11.2),
can be written as

ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955)
Albert Einstein (1879 –
1955) Einstein, one of the
greatest physicists of all
time, was born in Ulm,
Germany. In 1905, he
published three path-
breaking papers.In the
first paper, he introduced
the notion of light quanta
(now called photons) and
used it to explain the
features of photoelectric
effect. In the second paper,
he developed a theory of
Brownian 
motion,
confirmed experimentally a
few years later and provided
a convincing evidence of
the atomic picture of matter. The third paper gave birth
to the special theory of
relativity. In 1916, he
published the general
theory of relativity. Some of
Einstein’s most significant
later contributions are: the
notion 
of 
stimulated
emission introduced in an
alternative derivation of
Planck’s 
blackbody
radiation law, static model
of the universe which
started modern cosmology,
quantum statistics of a gas
of massive bosons, and a
critical analysis of the

mechanics. In 1921, he was

independent of the nature of the material. During 1906-1916, Millikan
performed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving
Einstein’s photoelectric equation. He measured the slope of the straight
line obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the
known value of e, he determined the value of Planck’s constant h. This
value was close to the value of Planck’s contant (= 6.626 × 10–34J s)
determined in an entirely different context. In this way, in 1916, Millikan
proved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric equation, instead of
disproving it. The successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis
of light quanta and the experimental determination of values of h and φ0,
in agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the
acceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect. Millikan verified
photoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals
over a wide range of radiation frequencies. 11.7  PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE PHOTON
Photoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in
interaction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of
energy, each of energy h ν. Is the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle? Einstein
arrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be
associated with momentum (h ν/c). A definite value of energy as well as
momentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated
with a particle. This particle was later named photon. The particle-like
behaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of
A.H. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons. In
1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution
to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. In 1923, Millikan was
awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary
charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect. We can summarise the photon picture of electromagnetic  radiation
as follows:
(i)
In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is
made up of particles called photons. (ii) Each photon has energy E (=hν) and momentum p (= h ν/c), and
speed c, the speed of light. (iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency  ν, or wavelength λ, have
the same energy E (=hν = hc/λ) and momentum  p (= hν/c= h/λ),
whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity
of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of
photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having
the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of
radiation. (iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and
magnetic fields. (v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the
total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number
of photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be
absorbed or a new photon may be created. Reprint 2025-26

11.8  WAVE NATURE OF MATTER
The dual (wave-particle) nature of light (electromagnetic radiation, in
general) comes out clearly from what we have learnt in this and the
preceding chapters. The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena
of interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in

photoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve
energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it
is made up of a bunch of particles – the photons. Whether
a particle or wave description is best suited for
understanding an experiment depends on the nature of
the experiment. For example, in the familiar  phenomenon
of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are
important. The gathering and focussing mechanism of
light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture. But its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina)
requires the photon picture of light. A natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-
particle) nature, might not the particles of nature (the
electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit wave-like character? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie
(pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the
bold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should
display wave-like properties under suitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the
two basic physical entities – matter and energy, must have
symmetrical character. If radiation shows dual aspects,
so should matter. De Broglie proposed that the wave
length l  associated with a particle of momentum p is
given as
l  = h
h
p
m v
=
(11.5)
where m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed. Equation (11.5) is known as the de Broglie relation and
the wavelength l of the matter wave is called de Broglie wavelength. The
dual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation. On the left hand
side of Eq. (11.5), l  is the attribute of a wave while on the right hand side
the momentum p is a typical attribute of a particle. Planck’s constant  h
relates the two attributes. Equation (11.5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose
validity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see
that it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen,
p = hn /c
(11.6)
Therefore,
h

(11.7)
That is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (11.5) equals
the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a
quantum of energy and momentum. Clearly, from Eq.(11.5 ), l  is smaller for a heavier particle (large m) or
more energetic particle (large v). For example, the de Broglie wavelength
of a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s–1 is easily
calculated:

This wavelength is so small that it is beyond any measurement. This

1. The minimum energy needed by an electron to come out from a  metal
surface is called the work function of the metal. Energy (greater than
the work function (fo) required for electron emission from the metal
surface can be supplied by suitably heating or applying strong electric
field or irradiating it by light of suitable frequency. 2. Photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons by metals
when illuminated by light of suitable frequency. Certain metals respond
to ultraviolet light while others are sensitive even to the visible light. Photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical
energy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric
emission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special
features. Reprint 2025-26

and Matter
3. Photoelectric current depends on (i) the intensity of incident light, (ii)
the potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and (iii)
the nature of the emitter material. 4. The stopping potential (Vo) depends on (i) the frequency of incident
light, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency
of incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential
is directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted:
e V0 = (1/2) m v2
max = Kmax. 5. Below a certain frequency (threshold frequency) n 0, characteristic of
the metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large
the intensity may be. 6. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of
photoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy
from radiation could not explain the independence of Kmax on
intensity, the existence of no and the instantaneous nature of the
process. Einstein explained these features on the basis of photon
picture of light. According to this, light is composed of discrete
packets of energy called quanta or photons. Each photon carries an
energy E (= h n) and momentum p (= h/l), which depend on the
frequency (n ) of incident light and not on its intensity. Photoelectric
emission from the metal surface occurs due to absorption of a photon
by an electron. 7. Einstein’s photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy
conservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in
the metal. The maximum kinetic energy (1/2)m v2
max is equal to
the photon energy (hn ) minus the work function f0 (= hn0) of the
target metal:
1
2 m v2
max = V0 e = hn – f0 = h (n – n0)
This photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric
effect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s
photoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s
constant h . This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description
(nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment
determines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for
understanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and
matter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie
attributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves
associated with the moving material particles are called matter waves
or de Broglie waves. 9. The de Broglie wavelength (l) associated with a moving particle is
related to its momentum p as:  l = h/p. The dualism of matter is
inherent in the de Broglie relation which contains a wave concept
(l) and a particle concept (p). The de Broglie wavelength is
independent of the charge and nature of the material  particle. It is
significantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing
in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons,
protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement, in case
of macroscopic objects, commonly  encountered in everyday life. Reprint 2025-26

POINTS TO PONDER
1. Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the
metal in a constant potential (This is only an approximation). They are
not free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get
out of the metal. 2. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules
in a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given
temperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s
distribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases. You will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do
with the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle. 3. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the energy
required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for different
electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional energy to
come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work function is
the least energy required by an electron to come out of the metal. 4. Observations on photoelectric effect imply that in the event of matter-
light interaction, absorption of energy takes place in discrete units of hn. This is not quite the same as saying that light consists of particles,
each of energy hn. 5. Observations on the stopping potential (its independence of intensity
and dependence on frequency) are the crucial discriminator between
the wave-picture and photon-picture of photoelectric effect. 6. The wavelength of a matter wave given by 
h
p
λ =
  has physical
significance; its phase velocity  vp has no physical significance. However,
the group velocity of the matter wave is physically meaningful and
equals the velocity of the particle. Physical

11.1  INTRODUCTION
The Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and Hertz experiments on
the generation and detection of electromagnetic waves in 1887 strongly
established the wave nature of light. Towards the same period at the end
of 19th century, experimental investigations on conduction of electricity
(electric discharge) through gases at low pressure in a discharge tube led
to many historic discoveries. The discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in 1895,
and of electron by J.J.Thomson in 1897, were important milestones in
the understanding of atomic structure. It was found that at sufficiently
low pressure of about 0.001 mm of mercury column, a discharge took
place between the two electrodes on applying the electric field to the gas
in the discharge tube.A fluorescent glow appeared on the glass opposite
to cathode. The colour of glow of the glass depended on the type of glass,
it  being  yellowish-green for soda glass. The cause of this fluorescence
was attributed to the radiation which appeared to be coming from the
cathode. These cathode rays were discovered, in 1870, by William
Crookes who later, in 1879, suggested that these rays consisted of streams
of fast moving negatively charged particles. The British physicist
J.J. Thomson (1856-1940) confirmed this hypothesis. By applying
mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields across the discharge
tube, J. J. Thomson was the first to determine experimentally the speed

and the specific charge [charge to mass ratio (e/m)] of the cathode ray
particles. They were found to travel with speeds ranging from about 0.1
to 0.2 times the speed of light (3 ×108 m/s).The presently accepted value
of e/m is 1.76 × 1011 C/kg. Further, the value of e/m was found to be
independent of the nature of the material/metal used as the cathode
(emitter), or the gas introduced in the discharge tube. This observation
suggested the universality of the cathode ray particles. Around the same time, in 1887, it was found that certain metals, when
irradiated by ultraviolet light, emitted negatively charged particles having
small speeds. Also, certain metals when heated to a high temperature were
found to emit negatively charged particles. The value of e/m of these particles
was found to be the same as that for cathode ray particles. These
observations thus established that all these particles, although produced
under different conditions, were identical in nature. J.J. Thomson, in 1897,
named these particles as electrons, and suggested that they were
fundamental, universal  constituents of matter. For his epoch-making
discovery of electron, through his theoretical and experimental
investigations on conduction of electricity by gasses, he was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. In 1913, the American physicist R.A. Millikan (1868-1953) performed the pioneering oil-drop experiment for
the precise measurement of the charge on an electron. He found that  the
charge on an oil-droplet was always an integral multiple of an elementary
charge, 1.602 × 10–19 C. Millikan’s experiment established that electric
charge is quantised. From the values of charge (e) and specific charge
(e/m), the mass (m) of the electron could be determined. 11.2  ELECTRON EMISSION
We know that metals have free electrons (negatively charged particles) that
are responsible for their conductivity. However, the free electrons cannot
normally escape out of the metal surface. If an electron attempts to come
out of the metal, the metal surface acquires a positive charge  and pulls the
electron back to  the metal. The free electron is thus held inside the metal
surface by the attractive forces of the ions. Consequently, the electron can
come out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome
the attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be
given  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This
minimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface
is called the work function of the metal. It is generally denoted by f0 and
measured in eV (electron volt). One electron volt is the energy gained by an
electron when it has been accelerated by  a  potential difference  of 1 volt, so
that  1 eV = 1.602 ×10–19 J. This unit of energy is commonly used in atomic and nuclear physics. The work function (f0)  depends on the properties of the metal and the
nature of its surface. The minimum energy required for the electron emission from the metal
surface can be supplied to the free electrons by any one of the following
physical processes:
(i)
Thermionic emission: By suitably heating, sufficient thermal energy
can be imparted to the free electrons to enable them to come out of the
metal. Reprint 2025-26
Physics
276
(ii) Field emission: By applying a very strong electric field (of the order of
108 V m–1) to a metal, electrons can be pulled out of the metal, as in a
spark plug. (iii) Photoelectric emission: When light of suitable frequency illuminates
a metal surface, electrons are emitted from the metal surface. These
photo(light)-generated electrons are called photoelectrons. 11.3  PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
11.3.1  Hertz’s observations
The phenomenon of photoelectric emission was discovered in 1887 by
Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), during his electromagnetic wave experiments. In his experimental investigation on the production of electromagnetic
waves by means of a spark discharge, Hertz observed that high voltage
sparks across the detector loop were enhanced when the emitter plate
was illuminated by ultraviolet light from an arc lamp. Light shining on the metal surface somehow facilitated the escape of
free, charged particles which we now know as electrons. When light falls
on a metal surface, some electrons near the surface absorb enough energy
from the incident radiation to overcome the attraction of the positive ions
in the material of the surface.After gaining sufficient energy from the
incident light, the electrons escape from the surface of the metal into the
surrounding space. 11.3.2  Hallwachs’ and Lenard’s observations
Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the phenomenon of
photoelectric emission in detail during 1886-1902. Lenard (1862-1947) observed that when ultraviolet radiations were
allowed to fall on the emitter plate of an evacuated glass tube enclosing
two electrodes (metal plates), current flows in the circuit (Fig. 11.1). As
soon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also
stopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall
on the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted
towards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons
flow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus,
light falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external
circuit. Hallwachs and Lenard studied how this photo current varied with
collector plate potential, and with frequency and intensity of incident light. Hallwachs, in 1888, undertook the study further and connected a
negatively charged zinc plate to an electroscope. He observed that the
zinc plate lost its charge when it was illuminated by ultraviolet light. Further, the uncharged zinc plate became positively charged when it was
irradiated by ultraviolet light. Positive charge on a  positively charged
zinc plate was found to be further enhanced when it was illuminated by
ultraviolet light. From these observations he concluded that negatively
charged particles were emitted from the zinc plate under the action of
ultraviolet light. After the discovery of the electron in 1897, it became evident that the
incident light causes electrons to be emitted from the emitter plate. Due

and Matter
to negative charge, the emitted electrons are pushed towards the collector
plate by the electric field. Hallwachs and  Lenard also observed that when
ultraviolet light fell on the emitter plate, no electrons were emitted at all
when the frequency of the incident light was smaller than a certain
minimum value, called the threshold frequency. This minimum frequency
depends on the nature of the material of the emitter plate. It was found that certain metals like zinc, cadmium, magnesium, etc.,
responded only to ultraviolet light, having short wavelength, to cause
electron emission from the surface. However, some alkali metals such as
lithium, sodium, potassium, caesium and rubidium were sensitive
even to visible light. All these photosensitive substances emit electrons
when they are illuminated by light. After the discovery of electrons, these
electrons were termed as photoelectrons. The phenomenon is called
photoelectric effect. 11.4 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC
EFFECT
Figure 11.1 depicts a  schematic view of the arrangement used for the
experimental study of the photoelectric effect. It consists of an evacuated
glass/quartz tube having a thin photosensitive plate C and another metal
plate A. Monochromatic light from the source S of sufficiently short
wavelength passes through the window W and falls on the photosensitive
plate C  (emitter). A transparent quartz window is sealed on to the glass
tube, which permits ultraviolet radiation to pass through it and irradiate
the photosensitive plate C. The electrons are emitted by the plate C and
are collected by the plate A (collector), by the electric field created by the
battery. The battery maintains the potential difference between the plates
C and A, that can be varied. The polarity of the plates C and A can be
reversed by a commutator. Thus, the plate A can be maintained at a desired
positive or negative potential with respect to emitter C. When the collector plate A is positive with respect to the
emitter plate C, the electrons are attracted to it. The
emission of electrons causes flow of electric current in
the circuit. The potential difference between the emitter
and collector plates is measured by a voltmeter (V)
whereas the resulting photo current flowing in the circuit
is measured by a microammeter (mA). The photoelectric
current can be increased or decreased by varying the
potential of collector plate A with respect to the emitter
plate C. The intensity and frequency of the incident light
can be varied, as can the potential difference V between
the emitter C and the collector A. We can use the experimental arrangement of Fig. 11.1 to study the variation of photocurrent with (a)
intensity of radiation, (b) frequency of incident radiation,
(c) the potential difference between the plates A and C,
and (d) the nature of the material of plate C. Light of
different frequencies can be used by putting appropriate
coloured filter or coloured glass in the path of light falling

278
on the emitter C. The intensity of light is varied by changing
the distance of the light source from the emitter. 11.4.1  Effect of intensity of light on photocurrent
The collector A is maintained at a positive potential with
respect to emitter C so that electrons ejected from C are
attracted towards collector A. Keeping the frequency of the
incident radiation and the potential fixed, the intensity of
light is varied and the resulting photoelectric current is
measured each time. It is found that the photocurrent
increases linearly with intensity of incident light as shown
graphically in Fig. 11.2. The photocurrent is directly
proportional to the number of photoelectrons emitted per
second. This implies that the number of photoelectrons
emitted per second is directly proportional to the intensity
of incident radiation. 11.4.2  Effect of potential on photoelectric current
We first keep the plate A at some positive potential with respect to the
plate C and illuminate the plate C with light of fixed frequency n  and fixed
intensity I1. We next vary the positive potential of plate A gradually and
measure the resulting photocurrent each time. It is found that the
photoelectric current increases with increase in positive (accelerating)
potential. At some stage, for a certain positive potential of plate A, all the
emitted electrons are  collected by the plate A and the photoelectric current
becomes maximum or  saturates. If we increase the accelerating potential
of plate A further, the photocurrent does not increase. This maximum
value of the photoelectric current is called  saturation current. Saturation
current corresponds to the case when all the photoelectrons emitted by
the emitter plate C reach the collector plate A. We now apply a negative (retarding)
potential to the plate A with respect to the
plate C and make it increasingly negative
gradually. When the polarity is reversed,
the electrons are repelled and only the
sufficiently energetic electrons are able to
reach the collector A. The photocurrent
is found to decrease rapidly until it drops
to zero at a certain sharply defined,
critical value of the negative potential V0
on the plate A. For a particular frequency
of incident radiation, the minimum
negative (retarding) potential V0 given to
the plate A for which the photocurrent
stops or becomes zero is called the cut-
off or stopping potential. The interpretation of the observation
in 
terms 
of 
photoelectrons 
is
straightforward. All the photoelectrons
emitted from the metal do not have the

same energy. Photoelectric current is zero when the stopping potential is
sufficient to repel even the most energetic photoelectrons, with the
maximum kinetic energy (Kmax), so that
Kmax = e V0
(11.1)
We can now repeat this experiment with incident radiation of the same
frequency but of higher intensity I2 and I3 (I3 > I2 > I1). We note that the
saturation currents are now found to be at higher values. This shows
that more electrons are being emitted per second, proportional to the
intensity of incident radiation. But the stopping potential remains the
same as that for the incident radiation of intensity I1, as shown graphically
in Fig. 11.3. Thus, for a given frequency of the incident radiation, the
stopping potential is independent of its intensity. In other words, the
maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on the light source
and the emitter plate material, but is independent of intensity of incident
radiation. 11.4.3 Effect of frequency of incident radiation on
stopping potential
FIGURE 11.4 Variation of photoelectric current
with collector plate potential for different
frequencies of incident radiation. FIGURE 11.5 Variation of stopping potential V0
with frequency n of incident radiation for a
given photosensitive material. We now study the relation between the frequency
n of the incident radiation and the stopping
potential V0. We suitably adjust the same
intensity of light radiation at various frequencies
and study the variation of photocurrent with
collector plate potential. The resulting variation
is shown in Fig. 11.4. We obtain different values
of stopping potential but the same value of the
saturation current for incident radiation of
different frequencies. The energy of the emitted
electrons depends on the frequency of the
incident radiations. The stopping potential is
more negative for higher frequencies of incident
radiation. Note from Fig. 11.4  that the stopping
potentials are in the order V03 > V02 > V01 if the
frequencies are in the order n3 > n2 > n1 . This
implies that greater the frequency of incident
light, greater is the maximum kinetic energy of
the photoelectrons. Consequently, we need
greater retarding potential to stop them
completely. If we plot a graph between the
frequency of incident radiation and the
corresponding stopping potential for different
metals we get a straight line, as shown in Fig. 11.5. The graph shows that
(i)
the stopping potential V0 varies linearly with
the frequency of incident radiation for a given
photosensitive material. (ii) there exists a certain minimum cut-off
frequency n0 for which the stopping potential
is zero. Reprint 2025-26
Physics
280
These observations have two implications:
(i)
The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons varies linearly
with the frequency of incident radiation, but is independent of its
intensity. (ii) For a frequency n of incident radiation, lower than the cut-off
frequency n0, no photoelectric emission is possible even if the
intensity is large. This minimum, cut-off frequency n0, is called the threshold frequency. It is different for different metals.Different photosensitive materials respond differently to light. Selenium
is more sensitive than zinc or copper. The same photosensitive substance
gives different response to light of different wavelengths. For example,
ultraviolet light gives rise to  photoelectric effect in copper  while green or
red light does not. Note that in all the above experiments, it is found that, if frequency of
the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency, the photoelectric
emission starts instantaneously without any apparent time lag, even if
the incident radiation is very dim. It is now known that emission starts in
a time of the order of 10– 9 s or less. We now summarise the experimental features and observations
described in this section. (i)
For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation
(above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly
proportional to the intensity of incident light (Fig. 11.2). (ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation,
saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of
incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of
its intensity (Fig. 11.3). (iii) For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum
cut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold
frequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place,
no matter how intense the incident light is. Above the threshold
frequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic
energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the
frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity
(Fig. 11.5). (iv) The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any
apparent time lag (~10– 9s or less), even when the incident radiation is
made exceedingly dim. 11.5 PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY
OF LIGHT
The wave nature of light was well established by the end of the nineteenth
century. The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were
explained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light. According to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting  of
electric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over
the region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this

wave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric
emission given in the previous section. According to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface
of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant
energy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are
the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater
the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron. In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the
surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no
matter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of
radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to
the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape
from the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist. These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i),
(ii) and (iii) given at the end of sub-section 11.4.3. Further, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of
energy by electron takes place continuously over the entire
wavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy,
the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small. Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single
electron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and
come out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to
observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous.In short,
the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of
photoelectric  emission. 11.6 EINSTEIN’S PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION: ENERGY
QUANTUM OF RADIATION
In 1905, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) proposed a radically new picture
of electromagnetic radiation to explain photoelectric effect. In this picture,
photoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of
energy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units – the
so called quanta of energy of radiation. Each quantum of radiant energy
has energy hn, where h is Planck’s constant and n the frequency of light. In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (hn ) of
radiation. If this quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum
energy needed for the electron to escape from the metal surface (work
function f0), the electron is emitted with maximum kinetic energy
Kmax = hn – f0
(11.2)
More tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less
than the maximum value. Note that the intensity of light of a given
frequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second. Increasing the intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons per
second. However, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted
photoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon. Equation (11.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation. We
now see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all
the observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of  sub-section
11.4.3. Reprint 2025-26

·
According to Eq. (11.2), Kmax depends linearly on n,
and is independent of intensity of radiation, in
agreement with observation. This has happened
because in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises
from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation
by a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is
proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit
area per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process. ·
Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (11.2 ) implies
that photoelectric emission is possible only if
h n > f0
or n > n0 , where
n0 = 
0
h
φ
(11.3)
Equation (11.3) shows that the greater the work
function f0, the higher the minimum or threshold
frequency n0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus,
there exists a threshold frequency n0 (= f0/h) for the
metal surface, below which no photoelectric  emission
is possible, no matter how intense the incident
radiation may be or how long it falls on the surface. ·
In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above,
is proportional to the number of energy quanta per
unit area per unit time. The greater the number of
energy quanta available, the greater is the number of
electrons absorbing the energy quanta  and greater,
therefore, is the number of electrons coming out of
the metal (for n > n0). This explains why, for n > n0,
photoelectric current is proportional to intensity. ·
In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process
involved in photoelectric effect is the absorption of a
light quantum by an electron. This process is
instantaneous. Thus, whatever may be the intensity
i.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area
per unit time, photoelectric emission is instantaneous. Low intensity does not mean delay in emission, since
the basic elementary process is the same. Intensity
only determines how many electrons are able to
participate in the elementary process (absorption of a
light quantum by a single electron) and, therefore, the
photoelectric current. Using Eq.(11.1), the photoelectric equation, Eq. (11.2),
can be written as

ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955)
Albert Einstein (1879 –
1955) Einstein, one of the
greatest physicists of all
time, was born in Ulm,
Germany. In 1905, he
published three path-
breaking papers.In the
first paper, he introduced
the notion of light quanta
(now called photons) and
used it to explain the
features of photoelectric
effect. In the second paper,
he developed a theory of
Brownian 
motion,
confirmed experimentally a
few years later and provided
a convincing evidence of
the atomic picture of matter. The third paper gave birth
to the special theory of
relativity. In 1916, he
published the general
theory of relativity. Some of
Einstein’s most significant
later contributions are: the
notion 
of 
stimulated
emission introduced in an
alternative derivation of
Planck’s 
blackbody
radiation law, static model
of the universe which
started modern cosmology,
quantum statistics of a gas
of massive bosons, and a
critical analysis of the
foundations of quantum
mechanics. In 1921, he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
physics for his contribution
to theoretical physics and
the photoelectric effect.Reprint 2025-26

independent of the nature of the material. During 1906-1916, Millikan
performed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving
Einstein’s photoelectric equation. He measured the slope of the straight
line obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the
known value of e, he determined the value of Planck’s constant h. This
value was close to the value of Planck’s contant (= 6.626 × 10–34J s)
determined in an entirely different context. In this way, in 1916, Millikan
proved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric equation, instead of
disproving it. The successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis
of light quanta and the experimental determination of values of h and φ0,
in agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the
acceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect. Millikan verified
photoelectric equation with great precision, for a number of alkali metals
over a wide range of radiation frequencies. 11.7  PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE PHOTON
Photoelectric effect thus gave evidence to the strange fact that light in
interaction with matter behaved as if it was made of quanta or packets of
energy, each of energy h ν. Is the light quantum of energy to be associated with a particle? Einstein
arrived at the important result, that the light quantum can also be
associated with momentum (h ν/c). A definite value of energy as well as
momentum is a strong sign that the light quantum can be associated
with a particle. This particle was later named photon. The particle-like
behaviour of light was further confirmed, in 1924, by the experiment of
A.H. Compton (1892-1962) on scattering of X-rays from electrons. In
1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contribution
to theoretical physics and the photoelectric effect. In 1923, Millikan was
awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the elementary
charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect. We can summarise the photon picture of electromagnetic  radiation
as follows:
(i)
In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is
made up of particles called photons. (ii) Each photon has energy E (=hν) and momentum p (= h ν/c), and
speed c, the speed of light. (iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency  ν, or wavelength λ, have
the same energy E (=hν = hc/λ) and momentum  p (= hν/c= h/λ),
whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity
of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of
photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having
the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of
radiation. (iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and
magnetic fields. (v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the
total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number
of photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be
absorbed or a new photon may be created. Reprint 2025-26

11.8  WAVE NATURE OF MATTER
The dual (wave-particle) nature of light (electromagnetic radiation, in
general) comes out clearly from what we have learnt in this and the
preceding chapters. The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena
of interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in
Reprint 2025-26

photoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve
energy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it
is made up of a bunch of particles – the photons. Whether
a particle or wave description is best suited for
understanding an experiment depends on the nature of
the experiment. For example, in the familiar  phenomenon
of seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are
important. The gathering and focussing mechanism of
light by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture. But its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina)
requires the photon picture of light. A natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-
particle) nature, might not the particles of nature (the
electrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit wave-like character? In 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie
(pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the
bold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should
display wave-like properties under suitable conditions. He reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the
two basic physical entities – matter and energy, must have
symmetrical character. If radiation shows dual aspects,
so should matter. De Broglie proposed that the wave
length l  associated with a particle of momentum p is
given as
l  = h
h
p
m v
=
(11.5)
where m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed. Equation (11.5) is known as the de Broglie relation and
the wavelength l of the matter wave is called de Broglie wavelength. The
dual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation. On the left hand
side of Eq. (11.5), l  is the attribute of a wave while on the right hand side
the momentum p is a typical attribute of a particle. Planck’s constant  h
relates the two attributes. Equation (11.5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose
validity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see
that it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen,
p = hn /c
(11.6)
Therefore,

(11.7)
That is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (11.5) equals
the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a
quantum of energy and momentum. Clearly, from Eq.(11.5 ), l  is smaller for a heavier particle (large m) or
more energetic particle (large v). For example, the de Broglie wavelength
of a ball of mass 0.12 kg moving with a speed of 20 m s–1 is easily
calculated:

This wavelength is so small that it is beyond any measurement. This
is the reason why macroscopic objects in our daily life do not show wave-
like properties. On the other hand, in the sub-atomic domain, the wave
character of particles is significant and measurable. Example 11.3 What is the de Broglie wavelength associated with (a) an
electron moving with a speed of 5.4´106 m/s, and (b) a ball of mass 150 g

Mass m = 9.11´10–31 kg, speed v = 5.4´106 m/s. Then, momentum

1. The minimum energy needed by an electron to come out from a  metal
surface is called the work function of the metal. Energy (greater than
the work function (fo) required for electron emission from the metal
surface can be supplied by suitably heating or applying strong electric
field or irradiating it by light of suitable frequency. 2. Photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons by metals
when illuminated by light of suitable frequency. Certain metals respond
to ultraviolet light while others are sensitive even to the visible light. Photoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical
energy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric
emission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special
features. Reprint 2025-26

Dual Nature of Radiation
and Matter
3. Photoelectric current depends on (i) the intensity of incident light, (ii)
the potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and (iii)
the nature of the emitter material. 4. The stopping potential (Vo) depends on (i) the frequency of incident
light, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency
of incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential
is directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted:
e V0 = (1/2) m v2
max = Kmax. 5. Below a certain frequency (threshold frequency) n 0, characteristic of
the metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large
the intensity may be. 6. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of
photoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy
from radiation could not explain the independence of Kmax on
intensity, the existence of no and the instantaneous nature of the
process. Einstein explained these features on the basis of photon
picture of light. According to this, light is composed of discrete
packets of energy called quanta or photons. Each photon carries an
energy E (= h n) and momentum p (= h/l), which depend on the
frequency (n ) of incident light and not on its intensity. Photoelectric
emission from the metal surface occurs due to absorption of a photon
by an electron. 7. Einstein’s photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy
conservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in
the metal. The maximum kinetic energy (1/2)m v2
max is equal to
the photon energy (hn ) minus the work function f0 (= hn0) of the
target metal:
1
2 m v2
max = V0 e = hn – f0 = h (n – n0)
This photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric
effect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s
photoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s
constant h . This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description
(nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment
determines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for
understanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and
matter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie
attributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves
associated with the moving material particles are called matter waves
or de Broglie waves. 9. The de Broglie wavelength (l) associated with a moving particle is
related to its momentum p as:  l = h/p. The dualism of matter is
inherent in the de Broglie relation which contains a wave concept
(l) and a particle concept (p). The de Broglie wavelength is
independent of the charge and nature of the material  particle. It is
significantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing
in crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons,
protons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta). However, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measurement, in case
of macroscopic objects, commonly  encountered in everyday life. Reprint 2025-26

POINTS TO PONDER
1. Free electrons in a metal are free in the sense that they move inside the
metal in a constant potential (This is only an approximation). They are
not free to move out of the metal. They need additional energy to get
out of the metal. 2. Free electrons in a metal do not all have the same energy. Like molecules
in a gas jar, the electrons have a certain energy distribution at a given
temperature. This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s
distribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases. You will learn about it in later courses, but the difference has to do
with the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle. 3. Because of the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal, the energy
required by an electron to come out of the metal is different for different
electrons. Electrons with higher energy require less additional energy to
come out of the metal than those with lower energies. Work function is
the least energy required by an electron to come out of the metal. 4. Observations on photoelectric effect imply that in the event of matter-
light interaction, absorption of energy takes place in discrete units of hn. This is not quite the same as saying that light consists of particles,
each of energy hn. 5. Observations on the stopping potential (its independence of intensity
and dependence on frequency) are the crucial discriminator between
the wave-picture and photon-picture of photoelectric effect. 6. The wavelength of a matter wave given by 
h
p
λ =
  has physical
significance; its phase velocity  vp has no physical significance. However,
the group velocity of the matter wave is physically meaningful and
equals the velocity of the particle. Physical
